# Constata GraphQL client for dotnet

This is a work in progress, you can:
- Make any query authenticated to our GraphQL API.
- Use convenience methods for the Attestation workflows.

Pending:
- More convenience methods for the Issuances API
- Publish to NuGet
- Make tests that don't rely on a local Constata development server.

You will need to signup to Constata and verify your email. Visit https://constata.eu, it's free.

We encourage you to signup a new account for developing your integration.

See [Demo Workflow Test](ApiClient.Tests/ApiClient_DemoWorkflow.cs) for usage examples.

Read it before you run it, as you will need to configure your own credentials and point to production.
